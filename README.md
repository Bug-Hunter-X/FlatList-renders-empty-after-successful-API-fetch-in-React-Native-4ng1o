# React Native FlatList Empty Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native remains empty even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The `ActivityIndicator` correctly displays while fetching, but the list fails to populate.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when using `FlatList` to render data retrieved from an API call.  The API request is successful (status 200), and the data is correctly parsed, but the `FlatList` component does not display the fetched data. The `ActivityIndicator` disappears, indicating the end of the fetch, but the FlatList remains blank.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the data passed to the FlatList is correctly structured and accessible.  The provided solution includes additional error handling and logging to assist in debugging similar issues.
